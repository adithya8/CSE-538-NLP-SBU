        This model defines a transition-based dependency parser which makes
        use of a classifier powered by a neural network. The neural network
        accepts distributed representation inputs: dense, continuous
        representations of words, their part of speech tags, and the labels
        which connect words in a partial dependency parse.

        This is an implementation of the method described in

        Danqi Chen and Christopher Manning.
        A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser Using Neural Networks. In EMNLP 2014.

        Parameters
        ----------
        embedding_dim : ``str``
            Dimension of word embeddings
        vocab_size : ``int``
            Number of words in the vocabulary.
        num_tokens : ``int``
            Number of tokens (words/pos) to be used for features
            for this configuration.
        hidden_dim : ``int``
            Hidden dimension of feedforward network
        num_transitions : ``int``
            Number of transitions to choose from.
        regularization_lambda : ``float``
            Regularization loss fraction lambda as given in paper.
        trainable_embeddings : `bool`
            Is the embedding matrix trainable or not.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : ``tf.Tensor``
            Tensorized version of the batched input text. It is of shape:
            (batch_size, num_tokens) and entries are indices of tokens
